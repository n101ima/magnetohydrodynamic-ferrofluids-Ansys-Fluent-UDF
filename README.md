# magnetohydrodynamic-ferrofluids-Ansys-Fluent-UDF
This UDF defines two source terms for the y and z components of the magnetic force acting on a ferrofluid in a cylindrical annulus. The ferrofluid is subjected to a magnetic field generated by a current flowing through the inner wall of the annulus. The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  Mn: the magnetic number, which is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the strength of the magnetic field. It is defined as $$Mn = \frac{\mu_0 \chi H_r^2 h^2}{\rho_{off} \alpha_{ff}^2}$$ where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\chi$ is the magnetic susceptibility of the ferrofluid, $H_r$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field at any point on the inner wall of

the annulus, $h$ is the height of the annulus, $\rho_{off}$ is the effective density of the ferrofluid, and $\alpha_{ff}$ is the effective magnetic permeability of the ferrofluid.
•  dp: the diameter of the ferromagnetic particles in the ferrofluid.

•  alfap: the volume fraction of the particles in the ferrofluid.

•  Rof: the density of the base fluid.

•  Rop: the density of the particles.

•  Muf: the dynamic viscosity of the base fluid.

•  xx: the magnetic susceptibility of the ferrofluid.

•  alfaff: the effective magnetic permeability of the ferrofluid.

•  Mu0: the permeability of free space.

•  Mub: the magnetic moment of a single particle.

•  Kb: the Boltzmann constant.

•  mp: the magnetic moment per unit volume of the ferrofluid. It is given by $$mp = \frac{4 \pi Mub}{6 \times 91.25 \times 10^{-30}} \left(\frac{dp}{2}\right)^3$$

•  Roff: the effective density of the ferrofluid. It is calculated as $$Roff = \alpha_p Rop + (1 + \alpha_p) Rof$$

•  I: the current flowing through the inner wall of the annulus. It can be obtained from $$I = 2 \pi b \sqrt{\frac{Mn \rho_{off} \alpha_{ff}^2}{\mu_0 \chi h^2}}$$

•  L: the length of the annulus.

•  ri: the inner radius of the annulus.

•  ro: the outer radius of the annulus.

•  tt: the thickness of the wall.

•  a: a constant defined as ro - ri - tt.

•  b: a constant defined as ro.

•  h: a constant defined as 2 * ri.

•  x[ND_ND]: an array that stores

the coordinates
of
the cell centroid.
•  y: the y coordinate

of
the cell centroid.
•  z: the z coordinate

of
the cell centroid.
•  Tem:

the temperature
of
the ferrofluid in Kelvin.
•  a1, a2, and

a3: auxiliary constants used to calculate
the magnetization
of
the ferrofluid. They are defined as $$a1 = \frac{6 mp}{\pi dp^3}$$ $$a2 = \frac{\mu_0 mp}{Kb Tem}$$ $$a3 = \frac{1}{a2}$$
•  fyz: a function

of y and z that represents
the distance from
the cell centroid to
the inner wall
of
the annulus. It is given by $$fyz = (y - a)^2 + (z - b)^2$$
•  Hyz: a function

of y and z that represents
the magnitude
of
the magnetic field at
the cell centroid. It is given by $$Hyz = \frac{I}{2 \pi \sqrt{fyz}}$$
•  Hr: a constant that represents

the magnitude
of
the magnetic field at any point on
the inner wall
of
the annulus. It is given by $$Hr = \frac{I}{2 \pi b}$$

•  Muff: an effective viscosity

of
the ferrofluid that accounts for
the particle-particle interactions. It is given by $$Muff = (1 + 2.5 \alpha_p) Muf$$

•  M: a function

of y, z, and Tem that represents
the magnetization
of
the ferrofluid at
the cell centroid. It is given by $$M = a1 \left(\coth(a2 Hyz) - \frac{a3}{Hyz}\right)$$

•  dHy and dHz: partial derivatives

of Hyz with respect to y and z, respectively. They are given by $$dHy = \frac{I (a - y)}{2 \pi fyz^{1.5}}$$ $$dHz = \frac{I (b - z)}{2 \pi fyz^{1.5}}$$
•  d2Hy and

d2Hz: second-order partial derivatives
of Hyz with respect to y and z, respectively. They are given by $$d2Hy = \frac{I}{2 \pi} \left(\frac{3 (y - a)^2}{fyz^{2.5}} - \frac{1}{fyz^{1.5}}\right)$$ $$d2Hz = \frac{I}{2 \pi} \left(\frac{3 (z - b)^2}{fyz^{2.5}} - \frac{1}{fyz^{1.5}}\right)$$
•  dMy and

dMz: partial derivatives
of M with respect to y and z, respectively. They are given by $$dMy = a1 a2 (y - a) \csch^2(a2 Hyz) \frac{I}{2 \pi fyz^{1.5}} - 2 \pi a1 a3 (y - a) fyz^{-0.5}$$ $$dMz = a1 a2 (z - b) \csch^2(a2 Hyz) \frac{I}{2 \pi fyz^{1.5}} - 2 \pi a1 a3 (z - b) fyz^{-0.5}$$
•  SourceTermy and

SourceTermz: source terms for
the y and z components
of
the magnetic force, respectively. They are given by $$SourceTermy = \mu_0 M dHy$$ $$SourceTermz = \mu_0 M dHz$$
•  dS[eqn]: an array that stores

the derivatives
of
the source terms with respect to
the dependent variables.

The UDF also defines two auxiliary functions:

•  csch1(u), which returns

the hyperbolic cosecant
of u. It is given by $$\csch(u) = \frac{2}{e^u - e^{-u}}$$
•  coth1(u), which returns

the hyperbolic cotangent
of u. It is given by $$\coth(u) = \frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{e^u - e^{-u}}$$

The UDF uses macros from
the Fluent UDF library, such as:

•  DEFINE_SOURCE, which defines a source term for a transport equation.

•  C_CENTROID, which returns

the coordinates
of
the cell centroid.
•  C_T, which returns

the temperature
of
the cell.
•  C_UDMI, which accesses or sets user-defined memory locations.

The UDF can be used to model magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in ferrofluids, such as flow instabilities, shape deformation, heat transfer, and mass transport.
